What is it?
===========
Ender-Sharp lets you create automatic bindings for C# for any library described with [Ender](https://github.com/turran/ender).

Dependencies
============
+ [Ender](https://github.com/turran/ender)
+ [Mono](http://www.mono-project.com/)

Building and Installation
=========================

How it works?

./ender2sharp.exe NAME
```
